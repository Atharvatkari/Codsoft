1) Number Guessing Game in Java
   This Java program implements a simple number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 0 and 99, and the player tries to guess it. The Game class manages the game logic, including 
   generating a random number, taking user input via Scanner, and providing feedback on whether the guess is too low or too high. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number, with the number of 
   attempts tracked and displayed upon success. This project is a practical example of Java fundamentals, covering concepts like classes, objects, random number generation, user input handling, loops, and 
   conditional statements.
